# Movie Rental Analysis with SQL

<p>I used MySQL to pull, analyze data, extract insights, and propose recommendations for a movie rental platform startup. The analysis involves:</p>

<ul>
<li>Getting to know the customers: where they are located, activation rate, activation timeframe, repeat customer rate</li>
<li>Understanding the rental performance: the most popular movies, highest-rated movies, best-performing genres, runtime preference, pricing optimization opportunities, and most popular actors
</li>
</ul>


The primary goal is to provide fundamental insights into the business performance and customer persona so that they can make more targeted, high-impact, and data-driven decisions to grow their business.
